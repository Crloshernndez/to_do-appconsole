It is super easy to have it at your disposal

in order to install and use the app you must have nodejs installed on your machine... :\

      don't worry ... if you don't have it, it's still very easy to install

        * to install nodejs I will leave the link below (it's simple .. believe me) follow the steps they indicate
          https://nodejs.org/en/download/

                        and that's all hehehehehe

        just check if it has been installed correctly by running in terminal '> node -v <'

      You already have it????
            If it is like this, perfect we already have half the road traveled ..... I think more than half
                Whats Next?

                  > you must create the folder where you want to have the app and enter it
                  > you must copy the repository with the following code "git@github.com:Crloshernndez/to_do-appconsole.git"
                                                              how? easy:
                         just copy in the terminal the following command ..... git clone git@github.com:Crloshernndez/to_do-appconsole.git
                  > then the necessary packages must be installed for its operation .... don't be scared, it's super easy:
                    you just have to run the following command "npm install"

           and that's it :o

              now every time you want to use the app, You just have to be in the folder where you saved the project and run the following command
                                    ****************************** npm start ******************************
